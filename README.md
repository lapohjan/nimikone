# Solita Name Sorter

This is a dev-academy-2021 exercise for Solita.
My task was to implement a name application.

Technologies used: React, Axios.

The data, names.json, contains the top-10 of both male and female names in Solita.

The json file has been used directly as the data source, but is being fetched from public folder by Axios.

The user interface provides the following requirements:
 - List names and amounts, order by amount, most popular first
 - List names in alphabetical order
 - Return the total amount of all the names
