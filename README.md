This is a dev-academy-2021 exercise for Solita.
My task is to implement a name application.

The application should have an user interface - either a web application or an api - or both.

The user interface should provide at least the first one of the following requirements:
 - List names and amounts, order by amount, most popular first
 - List names in alphabetical order
 - Return the total amount of all the names
 - Return the amount of the name given as a parameter

The data for the application is stored in a json file (names.json). The material contains the top-10 of both male and female names in Solita.

The json file can be used directly as the data source or it can be stored in a database.
